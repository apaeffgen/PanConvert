# Before you begin

- Install pandoc
- Get the path of pandoc 
- Fill in the preference - path to pandoc


## Path to pandoc

The program tries to detect where your pandoc executable is installed.
If that fails, you can use the preferences dialog in the Edit â€“ Menu to
manually save the path to the executable.


## System Requirements 

The binaries are self-contained. Only [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html) and optionally [multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/download/) have to be installed

For the source-code to be run, these additional Software-Packages have to be installed for running
PanConvert.
